                WALVIS BAY: THE INDUSTRIAL PULSE OF NAMIBIA’S ENERGY AMBITIONS
            </h2>
            <p class="mt-4">
                As Namibia’s undisputed logistics and engineering heart, Walvis Bay is undergoing a
                <strong>N$60 billion transformation</strong> from a traditional fishing hub into Africa’s
                premier offshore service base and a global green hydrogen gateway.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Youth in Oil and Gas Summit 2026 serves as the exclusive bridge between this massive
                infrastructure expansion and the local talent required to operate it.
            </p>
            <p>
                By connecting the <em>energy capital</em> with the <em>future workforce</em>, YIOGS ensures
                that the growth of the Port translates directly into high-value career pathways for Namibians.
